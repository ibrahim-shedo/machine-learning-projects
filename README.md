Introduction
This ReadMe file provides instructions for understanding and implementing a simple linear regression model. Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. One variable, denoted as 
𝑋
X, is considered the predictor or independent variable, and the other variable, denoted as 
𝑌
Y, is considered the response or dependent variable.
