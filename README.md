Simple Linear Regression ReadMe
Introduction
This ReadMe file provides instructions for understanding and implementing a simple linear regression model. Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. One variable, denoted as 
ùëã
X, is considered the predictor or independent variable, and the other variable, denoted as 
ùëå
Y, is considered the response or dependent variable.

Prerequisites
Before implementing a simple linear regression model, ensure you have the following:

Basic understanding of linear regression
Python installed on your machine
Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
Installation
Install the required libraries using pip if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset with two continuous variables. For demonstration, let's assume you have a CSV file named data.csv with two columns: X (predictor) and Y (response).

Steps to Implement Simple Linear Regression
1. Import Libraries
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
2. Load the Dataset
python
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = data[['X']].values  # Predictor
Y = data['Y'].values    # Response
3. Split the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
python
Copy code
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
4. Create and Train the Model
python
Copy code
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
5. Make Predictions
python
Copy code
Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
6. Evaluate the Model
python
Copy code
mse = mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(Y_test, Y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R^2 Score: {r2}')
7. Visualize the Results
python
Copy code
plt.scatter(X_test, Y_test, color='blue', label='Actual')
plt.plot(X_test, Y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Predicted')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.title('Simple Linear Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
